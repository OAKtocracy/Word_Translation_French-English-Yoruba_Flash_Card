# Word_Translation_French-English-Yoruba_Flash_Card
This project was built using Tkinter, the uploaded csv(words) file contains over 3,000 French words with corresponding English and Yoruba languages word. There is a front which displays the French word then the flash card flips after about 3 seconds to display the back side that shows the corresponding English and Yoruba words. There is a tick button that I click on if it's a word whose translation I already know, this would take out the word from the list and make the word not to show-up during the current session, then there is a cross button that I click on if it's a word whose translation I don't already know, this would make the word to show-up again after some time during the current session.
